# Description

This project was the first assignment I did in the course. It taught me how to write code correctly and solve algorithmic problems related to strings. There should also be a Unit-test.

## Task
```
Create a console application for reverse each word* in the input line

Example: 

All non-alphabetic symbols should stay in their original places.

Examples: 
"adcd efgh" => "dcba hgfe"
"Test" => "tseT"
"a1bcd efg!h" => "d1cba hgf!e" 
"a1bcd  efg!h" =>" d1cba  hgf1e" 

* Space is the divider for words in a line. 

** Spaces (as one of non alphabetic symbols) should not be deleted from the result string. 

Create a test project for checking the algorithm of the reverse.
```
